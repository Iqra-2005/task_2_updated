## 📂 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Description**: This dataset provides information on the fate of passengers aboard the Titanic, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age, and survival.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean the dataset by handling missing values and irrelevant features.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations.
- Identify trends and patterns related to survival.
- Summarize key observations from the analysis.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps

- Dropped columns with excessive missing values like `Cabin`.
- Filled missing values in `Age` and `Embarked` columns.
- Encoded categorical features like `Sex` for analysis.
- Converted data types and simplified feature sets for easier interpretation.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Using visualizations and statistical summaries, the following patterns were discovered:

- **Gender**: Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males.
- **Class**: First-class passengers had the highest chance of survival.
- **Age**: Children were more likely to survive than adults.
- **Fare**: Higher fares correlated with better survival rates.
- **Embarkation Port**: Passengers from Cherbourg ('C') had slightly better survival chances.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Survival strongly depended on social and economic factors.
- Women and children were given priority during evacuation.
- Wealthier passengers had better access to lifeboats.
